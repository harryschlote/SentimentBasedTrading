# SentimentBasedTrading

A project to scrape headlines from news sites, use NLP to score them and suggest whether certain stocks are likely to increase in value or not.

Retail trading performed by 'amatuer' investors is becoming more and more common. It has more than doubled between 2019 and 2020, and with more 'amatuers' trading and potentially making decisions based on news they see, sentiment analysis will become more important, with global banks already using these strategies.

This repository includes code to help make these decisions on whether stocks should be brought or sold. Data is extracted using FinViz (https://finviz.com/) using Python and then Pythons Natural Language Toolkit helps to analyse the headline data.
